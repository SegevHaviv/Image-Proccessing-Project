Part 1 - Identifying a letter out of a picture, using Tensorflow and MNIST dataset.

Part 2 - Identifying an animal among the given five animals specified at the start, using Keras and CIFAR 10 dataset. 

Part 3 - Coloring a black and white picture, currently has been experimented only on flowers but can be done on anything. Also, there's a rescaling neueral network for images, from 30pixels to 92.All has been done in Tensorflow.
